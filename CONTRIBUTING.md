## Translations (i18n)

### Translation domains

Common translations that are used on all pages (Nav, etc) are stored at `frontend/public/locales/{locale}/common.json`

Scopes (domains) are stored in separate json files at `frontend/public/locales/{locale}/{domain}.json`
One scope can combine the translations keys from several pages with common reusable strings ex. `auth` scope collects keys for `login` and `register` pages. 

### Translation keys

It is preferred to use kebab-case for translation keys and extract another level of nesting when the common prefix of the keys is above 3 or makes sense to be separated as new keys might be added in the future.

```json
{
  "cta": {
    "login": "Log In",
    "register": "Register",
    "send": "Send",
    "reset": "Reset"
  },
  "fields": {
    "email": "Email",
    "password": "Password",
    "confirm-password": "Confirm Password",
    "first-name": "First name",
    "last-name": "Last name"
  },
  "pages": {
    "forgotten-password": {
      "instructions": "To reset your password, please type your email address below. We will then send you an email with instructions to follow."
    }
  }
}
```
